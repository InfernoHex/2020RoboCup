# Good things!

## Some of the pros of my prototype I've been working on:
* Tail Whip | This may sound stupid but if the can is positioned
near the middle it will tail whip it out!
* It takes now less then 20sec for a full revolution!

# BAD THINGS!

## Some conns!
* Sometimes this happens and it drives backwards so it exits the rescue area!
* It will have to take around 40sec if miss the first revolution (though
also not that common!)
