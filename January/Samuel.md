# Observations:

Video:1
The first robot is not very stable
You robot needs to be stable for it to work sharper
Wheels and motors have to be stable to ensure sharp turning and proper reading of the board
Robots should not be wide to ensure sharp steering on the board
More connection points make the construction stable
The medium motor should not be obstructed
A shield is needed to avoid bad collisions
Shield also helps light sensors read information correctly
Brick needs to be attached properly to ensure code travels to motors and sensors

Video2
The ultrasonic sensor can compare many things
It can create values using guidelines and a data wire can output that. This will continue comparing until something tells it not to.

Video3
The robot needed 3ultrasonic sensors for it to work and code was not very reliable. 
It shows a quick way to repeat things
It is a bit complicated and may not work repeatedly
This video links with video2 with the ultrasonic sensor blocks

Video4/5
The colour sensor can compare many things
It can create values using guidelines and a data wire can output that.
It can create values using numbers 1/7 but when there is lots of different colours mix it may not read properly.
There is three things it can compare:
Colour (1 -7)
Reflected light intensity (light reflected from other objects)
Ambient light intensity (measuring the brightness)

# What we can do:

Make sure our robot is stable to avoid problems
Create our robots using strong bricks
Use sensors to make our robot do tasks easier
