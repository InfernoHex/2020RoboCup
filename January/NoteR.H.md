# Notes:
I learnt various methods of rescueing the robot from
the rescue are, and I've jotted down some:
* Sweeping (Where the robots goes forward until both sensors see white and go back, potentially
pushing the can out in a expeditious manner)
* Border Patrol (Roaming around the edge of the borders, looking for the can)
* Surface Detection (Going around and around in circles before detecting the can before going side to side to
see the best opening to rescue from)
